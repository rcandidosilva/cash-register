# cash-register

Create a cash register that should be able to accept only $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 bills. 
Given the charge and amount of money received return the change in each denomination that should be given from the cash register. 
Sometimes when the vendors couldnâ€™t make exact change they would tell us they couldnâ€™t make exact change.
Itâ€™s safe to assume that all output will be printed to the command line, below are some examples of how it would be used.

start program, waiting for command.

`> java Main ...`
 
`ready`

show current state in total and each denomination: $Total #$20 #$10 #$5 #$2 #$1.
for example $68 1 2 3 4 5 means:
Total=$68 $20x1 $10x2 $5x3 $2x4 $1x5.

`> show`
 
`$68 1 2 3 4 5`

put bills in each denomination: #$20 #$10 #$5 #$2 #$1 (show current state).

`> put 1 2 3 0 5`

`$128 2 4 6 4 10`

take bills in each denomination: #$20 #$10 #$5 #$2 #$1 (show current state).

`> take 1 4 3 0 5`

`$48 1 0 3 4 5`

given amount.

show change in each denomination: #$20 #$10 #$5 #$2 #$1 (and remove money from cash register).

`> change 8`

`0 0 1 1 1`
 
`> show`

`$40 1 0 2 3 4` 

show error if there is insufficient fund or no change can be made.

`> change 97`
 
`sorry`

exit program.

`> quit`

`bye`
